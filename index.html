			<h1>OUR SERVISES</h1>
			<img src="service.jpg">
			<p>This title and subject permeates the majority of Peter's paintings and photography for the last 35 years. From coastal Europe to Greece, Croatia and his origins in South Wales; the eclectic visual way water meets land has been a personal obsession. The visual feast of explosive waves, calm flood tides or even rain reflected in urban street scenes fuel Peter's work. This exhibition will feature a selection of recent oil paintings and photography.<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="-blank">READ MORE</a>
